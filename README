CGI-Application-Plus README File
================================


Description
-----------

This distribution is a complete new and stand alone reimplementation of CGI::Application module (i.e. B<it is not a subclass>). This means that it implements all the CGI::Application methods on its own, and adds several new features to your CGI::Application implementation, however maintaining intact the old ones.
